# Description
This project represents a small framework agnostic web component that provides a link back to the personal portfolio of James Watt. This allows any project to conveniently and consistently direct curious users back to his portfolio site.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Improve SEO for the James. Watt portfolio site by increasing the number of backlinks to it
- To help establish a consistent brand for James. Watt
- To aid in my own understanding of web components and npm

# TODO
- Make the anchor tag open up a modal that informs the user about where they are being redirected to
- Turn git repo into a shareable npm package
