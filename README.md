# Description
This project represents a small framework agnostic web component that provides a link back to the personal portfolio of James Watt. This allows any project to conveniently and consistently direct curious users back to his portfolio site.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Improve SEO for the James. Watt portfolio site by increasing the number of backlinks to it
- To help establish a consistent brand for James. Watt
- To aid in my own understanding of web components and npm

# TODO
- Turn git repo into a shareable npm package
- Maybe turn entire project to typescript
- Think about what should and should not be attributes
- Update this readme with commands for local development
- Publish NPM module
